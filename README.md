# Semantic Segmentation Model

Implement and train a **semantic segmentation model** based on the U-Net architecture. 

The goal is to perform classification of images using a deep learning model. This serves as a stepping stone towards building my next project: Image Diffusion Model

---

## Current Features
- U-Net implementation with encoder-decoder structure.

---

## Future Plans
- Train and evaluate the model on augmented datasets.

---

Stay tuned for updates!
